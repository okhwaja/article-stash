Article Stash
=============

For the article-reading procrastinator 

Built primarily as a learning exercise for Chrome extensions. 

Usage
-------------

Interaction with the extension can be done via the popup or with keyboard shortcuts (recommended).

When you want to save a web page, either open the popup and click add or use the keyboard shortcut 'Alt+Shift+S'.
The popup badge will indicate how many articles are currently in your stash.

To access web pages in your stash, you can either open the popup and click the link from the menu or you
can select an article at random. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut 'Alt+Shift+L' to select randomly. 

Once articles are selected, they are automatically removed from the stash
